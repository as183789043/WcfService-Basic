# WCF Basic Service & Testing Example (WcfService-Basic)

## Description:
This repository contains my initial C# project, demonstrating the construction of a basic WCF service provider. To validate the service's functionality, a simple Web Forms application and the WCF Test Client are included.

## Note
This project is intended for beginners to learn the fundamentals of building a basic WCF service and related testing applications.
Visual Studio 2022 or a later version is recommended for opening this project.
Ensure that .NET Framework 4.7.2 or a later version is installed in your development environment.

### Service Functionality:
HelloWorld: Returns the string "Hello World".
PiValue: Returns the value of Pi (Ï€).
AbsValue: Returns the absolute value of an input integer.
